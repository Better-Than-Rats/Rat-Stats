# Rat-Stats
This is an app that was made by rats for rats.

Description:
In this app, after the user logs in, they can click anywhere on the map and create a new rat sighting, and write in what the 
name of the rat they saw is, as well as a description of the rat. Once submitting, a rat appears on the map and is 
visible to other users.
